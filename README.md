## Manuals
Extensively revised and updated manuals are now available [at a new location](https://biosaxs-com.github.io/atsas/4.0.0/manuals/).

That said, not all manuals could be finished in time for the 4.0 release. However, they will be
added as soon as possible and further updated over time.

In case a manual you are looking for is either missing, out of date, incomplete or contains an error,
please consider submitting an [Issue report](#reporting-an-issue).


## Forum/Discussions
ATSAS-Community includes a [Discussion Board](https://github.com/biosaxs-com/atsas-community/discussions).

Post questions and answers, submit Ideas for future ATSAS releases and generally discuss with
other users and the developers. If you encountered an issue with any ATSAS application, please
consider submitting an [Issue report](#reporting-an-issue) instead of posting in the discussion forum.

Since 2008, the [forum over at saxier.org](https://saxier.org/forum) provided a place for this type
of discussions. To preserve the valuable information of this forum, we imported all posts to the
Discussions board where they can be searched as needed. Please note that all saxier.org threads
are locked and labelled https://github.com/biosaxs-com/atsas-community/labels/saxier-org. To continue
a discussion started at saxier.org, please start a new Discussion, referencing the previous thread.


## Reporting an Issue
ATSAS-Community also includes an [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/biosaxs-com/atsas-community/issues).

Please submit any Issues you encounter with any of the ATSAS applications and provide the required information
to reproduce:
 - output of "any-program -v"
 - all inputs to the program
 - the output of the program
 - screenshots to highlight and data as needed to reproduce

In addition, please point out omissions in the manuals or anything that can be improved in future releases.
To submit Ideas, please use the [Ideas forum](https://github.com/biosaxs-com/atsas-community/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Wiki
ATSAS-Community also provides a user-editable [Wiki](https://github.com/biosaxs-com/atsas-community/wiki).

Feel free to create pages for any of the ATSAS applications and provide whichever information you
consider important to share. For example: Tips&Tricks, relevant publications, use cases, but also
limitations of certain applications.
